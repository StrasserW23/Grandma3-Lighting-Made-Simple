        <h2>Phasers</h2>
        <p>In grandMA3, a phaser is a dynamic tool that generates movement, color chases, and automated repeating effects by cycling between two or more steps. Unlike static presets, which consist of a single step, phasers run through multi-step sequences, giving you control over parameters such as speed, phase, width, and transitions to create intricate, evolving lighting designs.</p>

        <h3>Effects</h3>
<Li><b>Fly-Outs:</b> A fly-out is when lights move quickly from one position to another — usually outward or off a focal point. What it looks like on stage: Beams start centered on an artist Then suddenly “fly” outward across the stage or audience Creates energy and expansion How it’s used in grandMA3: You create this using: Position presets A movement effect (often a one-shot or short effect) Fast transition timing It’s common in big musical hits or drops — think stadium rock moments.</li>

<li><b>Figure 8s:</b>A movement pattern where a moving head traces the shape of the number 8. What it looks like on stage: Smooth looping motion Dynamic but not chaotic Great for songs that need flow How it works in grandMA3: You use a position effect with:X and Y phase offset Sine wave shapes Adjusted width and speed Because grandMA3 uses a powerful effects engine, you can control: Size of the 8 Speed Phase between fixtures. This is common in worship environments (like what you do at Rivers Crossing) or mid-tempo songs.</li>

<li><b>Circles:</b> A movement pattern where lights move in a circular motion. What it looks like on stage: Smooth orbiting beams Can be tight and subtle or wide and dramatic How you program it? In grandMA3:Use a position effect Apply sine wave on X and cosine on Y Adjust phase to spread fixtures evenlyCircles are cleaner and more predictable than figure 8s.</li>

  <b>Chase:</b> A chase is when lights turn on and off in sequence. What it looks like: Lights “run” across the stage Creates rhythm and movement Think classic rock or EDM builds In grandMA3: You create a chase using: Step-based sequences Cue timing Or a dimmer effect with phase spread You can chase: Dimmer Color Position Beam effects Chases are heavily timing-based — very musical.

<li><b>Dimus:</b> I’m assuming you meant Dimmer or Dimmer effects. What it is: Controls the brightness of fixtures. What it looks like: Pulsing Flashing Breathing effects Strobes In grandMA3: Use: Dimmer effects Waveforms (sine, square, ramp, etc.) Speed master control</li>

<p>Dimmer effects are some of the most powerful tools for matching music energy — especially in high-impact songs.</p>

        <h2>Gobos</h2>
        <p>In grandMA3 you don’t physically insert gobos — you control them digitally by adjusting fixture parameters:</p>

         <p>A gobo is a small, stenciled, or etched metal or glass disc placed inside a lighting fixture to project patterns, images, or logos onto surfaces. </p>
          
        <P>Standing for "Goes Between Optics" (or "Go Before Optics"), it acts as a template to shape light for theatrical, corporate, or event design. </p>

<li><b>Selection</b> – Chooses which pattern is active</li>

<li><b>Gobo Rotation</b> – Spins the pattern</li>

<li><b>Gobo Indexing</b> – Locks the gobo at a precise angle</li>

<li><b>Gobo Shake</b> – Adds a vibration/shimmer effect</li>

<li><b>Gobo Morph</b> – Transitions between gobos (on some fixtures)</li>

<p>These controls live in the fixture’s attribute encoder pages (usually under Beam).</p>
